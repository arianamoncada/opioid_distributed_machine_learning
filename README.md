# Pain Pill Inflow vs. Suicide Rate in California
We conducted an analysis using PySpark and an EMR distributed system on AWS, regarding the flow of opioids throughout the United States from a [dataset](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/07/18/how-download-use-dea-pain-pills-database/?arc404=true),supplied by the Washington Post, to determine whether or not a relationship existed between number of opioids in a geographical region and the suicide rate in that region.
